# ProofOrigin Vault — Recovery & Key Ring (Phase 1+)

This document defines the zero-knowledge recovery model for the Private Vault. It is the source of truth for future passkey, PIN, and recovery-kit work.

## Policy (non-negotiable)

ProofOrigin **cannot decrypt** user vault documents. The server stores ciphertext and metadata only.

| Allowed | Not allowed |
|---------|-------------|
| Client-side passkey unlock | Email or SMS “reset my vault” |
| Client-side PIN fallback | ProofOrigin staff unlock |
| User-held recovery kit export | Server-held master vault key (MVK) |
| Encrypted recovery blob the user controls | Automatic cloud backup of MVK or recovery phrase |
| Explicit “no kit = unrecoverable” consent | Social recovery or admin override |

**If the user loses their device and did not save a recovery kit, the vault is unrecoverable by design.** This is intentional, not a support gap.

## Key Ring architecture

The vault moves from **PIN-derived document keys** to a **Master Vault Key (MVK)** model:

```
Recovery phrase (Phase 2+) ──wraps──► MVK ──HKDF──► Document encryption key
Passkey (Phase 2+)       ──wraps──► MVK
PIN (fallback)           ──wraps──► MVK
```

- **MVK:** Random 256-bit secret generated at vault setup. Never sent to ProofOrigin servers.
- **Document key:** Derived from MVK via HKDF (see `app/lib/vaultCrypto.js`). AAD still binds ciphertext to device scope until Phase 2 custody transfer.
- **PIN wrap:** PBKDF2 + AES-256-GCM protects MVK locally (`app/lib/vaultKeyRing.js`).
- **Passkey wrap:** Planned — WebAuthn PRF when available; gates local MVK wrap (Phase 2).
- **Recovery kit:** Planned — user-held phrase encrypts MVK export; setup/export UI in a later commit.

## Unlock priority (target behavior)

1. **Passkey** — primary when enrolled (local WebAuthn, no server key material).
2. **PIN** — fallback when passkey unavailable or user chooses PIN.
3. **Recovery kit** — disaster recovery on a new device (Phase 2+); requires phrase or imported kit file.

Session behavior (vanish mode, Protected View) is unchanged by the Key Ring.

## User scenarios

### Daily unlock (same device)

Passkey or PIN unwraps MVK in browser memory only. MVK is cleared on vanish / lock.

### Forgotten PIN

- Passkey enrolled → unlock with passkey, set new PIN, re-wrap MVK.
- Recovery kit saved → phrase unwraps MVK, set new PIN.
- Neither → **unrecoverable**.

### Lost phone

Requires recovery kit (Phase 2). Same-device Phase 1 does not promise cross-device restore.

### Stolen phone

User marks vault **compromised** (existing flow). Attacker needs PIN/passkey to decrypt. Recovery on new device uses recovery kit + device re-registration (Phase 2).

## Phase roadmap

| Phase | Scope |
|-------|--------|
| **1 — Commit 1** | `vaultKeyRing.js` + spec; tests only; no production change |
| **1 — Commit 2** | MVK storage on **new** vault setup; `isVaultUsingMasterVaultKey()`; legacy unlock/crypto unchanged |
| **1 — Commit 3** | Unlock branching + MVK-mode crypto; `encryption_version` 2 for MVK uploads; legacy vaults unchanged |
| **1 — Commit 4** | Legacy vault migration to MVK on unlock (optional future commit) |
| **1 — Commit 5** | Passkey enroll/unlock (no recovery UI) |
| **1 — Commit 6** | Recovery kit generate/export + acknowledgment gate |
| **2** | Cross-device recovery, `vault_id` device registry, ciphertext re-homing |

## Storage

Wrapped MVK records live in browser `localStorage` (`prooforigin_vault_wrapped_mvk_v1`) after **brand-new vault setup** only. Existing vaults without this key remain on the legacy PIN-derived path.

### Commit 3 — encryption versions

| `encryption_version` | Vault mode | Document root key |
|---------------------|------------|-------------------|
| `1` | Legacy or MVK (v1 docs) | PIN-derived bytes (`legacyPinKey`) |
| `2` | MVK-mode uploads | Unwrapped MVK (`masterVaultKey`) |

- **Legacy vault** (no wrapped MVK): unlock, upload, and decrypt unchanged — all use PIN-derived root, version `1`.
- **MVK vault** (wrapped MVK present): unlock stores both MVK and legacy PIN key; new uploads use MVK + version `2`; v1 documents (e.g. Commit 2 gap) decrypt with legacy PIN key.
- **No migration** and **no re-encryption** in Commit 3.

Run `docs/sql/vault_encryption_v2.sql` on Supabase before MVK-mode uploads (`encryption_version = 2`).

Wrapped records must never contain plaintext MVK.
